## How to Calculate the Network Address and Broadcast Address
Given IP address: 193.16.20.35/29
Step1: Write the given IP address in binary format.

Step 2: Write the subnet mask in binary form.

Step: Perform the logical operation between the corresponding octets of the IP address and the subnet mask.

Step 4: Convert the result back to the decimal format and this will be the network address.

IP adrress = 193.16.20.36/29
Binary Equivalent = 11000001.00010000.00010100.00100100
Netmask = 11111111.11111111.11111111.11111000
Using Logiacal AND Method 
`NetworkIP: 193.16.20.32`

BroadcastIP=>(Magic Number+NetworkId-1)
8+32-1=39
`BroadcastIP = 193.16.20.39`

Host Range of IP Adrresses that can be assigned to hosts lie between the Netowrk IP and Broadcast IP

Host Ranges: 
 * `193.16.20.33`
 * `193.16.20.34`
 * `193.16.20.35`
 * `193.16.20.36`
 * `193.16.20.37`
 * `193.16.20.38`
